# Engraver

Scripts to generate engraving files from audio.

## Installation

1. Install conda (for example, from [Miniforge](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/)).
1. Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core?tab=readme-ov-file) to install the library. (Only required for legacy version)
1. Install all other packages listed in *requirements.txt*

## Usage

1. Add your *.mp3* audio file to the *audio_files* folder
1. In *parameters.py*, edit *input_filename* with the name of your file. Modify any other relevant parameter.
1. Run *main.py* and check that it created a new engraving file named *input_filename.iso*
1. Copy the file to a USB stick
1. Run the program on the CNC machine (TRIDENT TR 60A)

# Documentation

## Architecture

The software is organized into multiple files to improve readability. They are:

1. **main.py:** Calls functions from other modules to create the engraving files.
1. **audio_processor.py:** Reads, filter, crop, extend, and extract the amplitude of audio files.
1. **amp2engraving.py:** Convert an amplitude series to an engraving object.
1. **exporter.py:** Saves an engraving object in different formats.
1. **parameters.py:** Groups all software parameters in a single structure and saves it as a text file.
1. **geometry.py:** Mathematical utility functions to switch between coordinate frames.

## Current version: G-code creator

The current state of the project can generate G-codes for the TRIDENT TR 60A. The python script reads an audio file and extracts an amplitude time series. It is then converted into a helical path that the engraving tip must follow. This path is exported as a G-code file (or multiple to respect the size limit) that is ready to use on the machine.


# Legacy documentation
Many features included in the code are not relevant for the final use, as the engraving technique has changed multiple times. Here is some information about those topics.


## Construction of a volumic engraving using a CAD software

The engraving automation is split in two part: Python and a CAD Macro. Both SolidWorks and FreeCAD can be used. FreeCAD struggles to perform clean volumic engraving but is faster for 3D sketches.

### Python: From audio to trajectory

A Python script (*main.py*) reads an audio file. From the amplitude time series of the audio, a 3D trajectory is generated following a helical path. This trajectory is cut into several pieces, each spanning half a turn, saved individually in a *.csv* file. All files are in a designated folder.

All parameters can be modified in *parameters.py*.

### CAD Macro: From trajectory to 3D shape

The Macro starts by creating the Z axis and a cylinder. Then, for each .csv file in the designated folder, the following actions occur: 

1. Create a 3D sketch of the trajectory
1. Create a 3D sketch of the groove cross section
1. Perform a swept cut with the two sketches

Most graphical updates and other options are disabled during the generation to accelerate the process.

**Parameters of the cylinder (radius, length) in the macro must agree with the Python script to avoid errors.**

### Why is it no longer used?

1. Large file size: Obtained 3D files are over 500 MB for 5 s of sound. CAM software struggle to work with such large files. For example, Techgraving was not able to create programs from any of the files.
1. Generation time: The 3D file generation is exceptionnaly slow even on powerful computers. It is limited by SolidWorks; volume operations are performed CPU only and is not threadable. 


## Construction of a volumic engraving using Python

### Principle

A Python script reads an audio file. From the amplitude time series of the audio, a 3D trajectory is generated following a helical path. Then, pythonocc-core is used to create a cylinder and engrave the path. Each segment is engraved individually, as I did not figure out how to use the sweep function.

### Why is it no longer used?

1. Same drawbacks as the CAD software option
1. Limited output formats: Only .STEP files can be created.
1. UI: This method does not provide a basic user interface. Therefore, checking the results is annoying and time consuming.


## Construction of a surface depth map

### Principle

The engraving is represented as an image. The image represents the unravelled surface of the cylinder. The intensity of each pixel indicates the depth to engrave; black is the deepest. The image is saved in a lossless format to keep all details.

### Why is it no longer used?

1. Projection warpings: Techgraving encountered some warping while projecting the image to a cylinder. Thus, the sound would be warped, and the edges would not meet perfectly "at the back of the cylinder".
